Hi, my name is Matthew Niemiro. 

## About Me

I am an undergraduate at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I expect to graduate in 2024 with a degree in mathematics (major) and computer science (minor).

My email: (mylastname)2(at)illinois(dot)edu

## About This Site

I made this site to organize my mathematical notes, papers, thoughts, etc. that I have written or plan to write. It is also motivational, since in theory other people now see my work.

## About My Notes

For the most part, my notes will include anything I have written that is (i) small in scope, (ii) not written for some major assignment, and (iii) coherent to general readers.

As a personal project, I try to write at least one short note every 2-4 weeks focusing on a topic I feel I ought to understand better.
