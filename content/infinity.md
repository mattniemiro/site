It's a basic, cool, and important fact that spaces and categories have a common generalization in ∞-categories. This is a first step toward realizing an important relationship between space and algebra, and this buys you e.g. the application of higher category theory to algebraic topology, geometry, ... And these applications have had serious successes, e.g. the proof of the geometric cobordism hypothesis. Nowadays, ∞-categories are the "right" way to talk about and understand concepts in many parts of modern mathematics. That includes the mathematics I am interested in. 

For those reasons, I'm studying higher category theory. Probably a serious goal is to read Jacob Lurie's *Higher Topos Theory*, but that's a tough (huge) read, and not even the end-all-be-all. So I'll be drawing on many references. 

As a personal project, I'm texing [notes](/htt2.pdf) for this. The motto is "slow and steady." I'm not pruning these notes, they're for my own reference. Maybe they will be useful for something more intentional and comprehensive in the future.

UPDATE: this spring, some grad students are arranging a reading course on the subject. I am joining them for some time. They are following closely Charles Rezk's notes (under his advision).
