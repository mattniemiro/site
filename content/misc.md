Interesting papers, resources, etc. (Mostly math-related.)

1. [Quiver](https://q.uiver.app/): a modern commutative diagram editor.
2. [GÃ¶del diffeomorphisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06735): the tasks of proving certain statements (e.g. the Riemann hypothesis, consistency of ZFC) turn out to be equivalent to proving certain diffeomorphisms of the torus are isomorphic to their inverses.
3. [Grothendieck-Serre correspondences](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/Letters/GS.pdf): a collection of correspondences between Alexander Grothendieck and Jean-Pierre Serre.
4. [A visualization of the Hopf fibration](https://nilesjohnson.net/hopf.html) by Niles Johnson.
5. [Tohoku](https://inference-review.com/article/tohoku), an enjoyably-technical, if not somewhat sensational, article about Grothendieck's landmark Tohoku paper.
