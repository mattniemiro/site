1. [Introduction to de Rham cohomology.](/drc.pdf) Notes on de Rham cohomology from 2021.
2. [The derived functor approach to sheaf cohomology.](http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2021/REUPapers/Niemiro.pdf) My paper for the University of Chicago REU, 2021. Last updated 9/29/2021.
3. [Course notes for 514, Complex Algebraic Geometry.](/math514.pdf) Notes for Math 514. Incomplete because I had Covid for 10 weeks. These will probably only be helpful to classmates and for future writing.
4. [The Adams conjecture and the K-theory of finite fields.](http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2022/REUPapers/Niemiro.pdf) With Zhong Zhang. Our paper for the University of Chicago REU, 2022. Last updated 3/10/2023.
5. [Lecture notes for UChicago REU condensed math seminar.](content\condensed-seminar.md) I am organizing this with Michael Barz.

**Upon request**
1. Sheaf cohomology notes -- I gave a 7-week seminar on sheaves and sheaf cohomology for the 2022 Chicago REU. Others gave special talks toward the end too. Partial and unsatisfactory notes for these lectures exist.
