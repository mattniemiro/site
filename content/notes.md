1. [Introduction to de Rham cohomology.](/drc.pdf) Notes I wrote while studying de Rham cohomology sometime in 2021.

3. [Course notes for 514, Complex Algebraic Geometry.](/math514.pdf) Notes for Math 514. These are incomplete. Also, I had Covid for the first 10 weeks of this course, which might have affected the quality of these notes. Last updated in 2022.
