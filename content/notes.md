**Unsorted**
1. [Introduction to de Rham cohomology.](/drc.pdf) Notes I wrote while studying de Rham cohomology sometime in 2021.
2. [The derived functor approach to sheaf cohomology.](http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2021/REUPapers/Niemiro.pdf) My paper for the University of Chicago REU, 2021. Last updated 9/29/2021.
3. [Course notes for 514, Complex Algebraic Geometry.](/math514.pdf) Notes for Math 514. Incomplete--I had Covid for 10 weeks. These will probably only be helpful to classmates and for future writing.

**Upon request**
1. Sheaf cohomology notes -- I put together a 7-week lecture series on sheaves and sheaf cohomology for the 2022 Chicago REU. Others gave special talks toward the end too. Partial and unsatisfactory notes for these lectures exist.
